TERMINAL STATES (definitive endpoints):

2. COMPLETED.VALIDATED_NOT_PURSUED - Validated concept but strategically chose not to proceed
3. TERMINATED.INVALIDATED - Core hypothesis disproven through validation/testing
4. TERMINATED.PIVOTED - Original pursuit ended, pivoting to new direction
5. TERMINATED.ABANDONED - External factors forced termination (resources, org changes)
6. TERMINATED.OBE - Overtaken By Events (competitor launched, regulations changed, market shifted)

NOT TERMINAL:
7. ACTIVE - Pursuit is ongoing, including if paused/suspended with intent to resume

   - Only extract if explicitly mentioned (e.g., "started on February 25th")
   - This is NOT a milestone - it's metadata about when the project began

2. MILESTONES: Future target dates for deliverables, releases, etc.
   - Look for: "by March", "release on May 1", "complete by", "due on", "deadline is"
   - These are FUTURE targets, not past events

IMPORTANT - Milestone types:
- "release" = product launch, initial release, go-live, ship date, "be complete by"
- "validation" = testing, QA, user testing, beta
- "deliverable" = design complete, prototype ready, feature done
- "phase_end" = end of a phase (Vision, De-Risk, Deploy)
- "external" = conferences, demos, investor meetings
