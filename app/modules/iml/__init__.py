IML Momentum Pattern Module

InDE MVP v4.5.0 — The Engagement Engine

This module extends the existing IML (Innovation Machine Learning) layer
with momentum pattern learning capabilities. It closes the intelligence
loop: momentum signals accumulated across pursuits become cross-innovator
patterns that inform coaching decisions.

Components:
  - MomentumPatternPersistence: MongoDB read/write for momentum_patterns
  - MomentumPatternEngine: Background aggregation of momentum snapshots
  - MomentumLiftScorer: Scores bridges/insights by momentum-lift potential

Design Principles:
  - Patterns are ALWAYS anonymized — no PII or pursuit-specific identifiers
  - Pattern aggregation runs in the background — never on coaching path
  - All scoring has graceful fallback to neutral when data is insufficient
  - The static bridge library is NEVER replaced — only augmented
