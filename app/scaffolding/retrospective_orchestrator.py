InDE MVP v4.5.0 - Retrospective Orchestrator

Orchestrates retrospective conversations and artifact generation.
Uses three-tier prompt composition: Core + Methodology + Outcome.

Progressive Flow:
1. Initialize retrospective session
2. Guide through 6-8 structured questions
3. Generate .retrospective artifact
4. Extract proto-patterns for learning library
5. Cross-validate fears with outcomes

v2.8 Enhancements:
- Early exit capability (partial completion)
- Pause and resume support
- Gentle completion prompts
- Partial artifact generation

v4.5.0 Enhancement:
- Momentum Trajectory dimension added to retrospective learning capture
